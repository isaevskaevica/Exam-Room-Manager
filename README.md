# Exam room resource management application

> Project for the course **Web Programming** at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering (FINKI), Ss. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje.

---

## Overview

A web application for professors and assistant professors to schedule and reserve classrooms for exams at the faculty. Professors can log in, view their assigned subjects, pick an exam date through a calendar, fill in exam details, browse available classrooms with automatic conflict detection, and reserve one or more rooms, with unavailable rooms clearly marked. The application also includes a machine learning model that predicts the expected student attendance based on enrollment data, helping the professors choose appropriately sized classrooms more accurately.

## Features

- **Professor Authentication** — Secure login with Spring Security.
- **Subject Dashboard** — Each professor can see only the subjects that they have been assigned to in the last 2 semesters of the current year.
- **Exam Details Form** — Input start time, duration, number of students, and exam type before seeing classrooms.
- **Classroom Browser** — All classrooms displayed with capacity and computer availability.
- **Conflict Detection** — Classrooms already booked for the selected time slot are shown with a blue background and marked UNAVAILABLE.
- **Filtering** — Filter classrooms by computer availability (`WITH_COMPUTERS` / `WITHOUT_COMPUTERS`)
- **Attendance Prediction** - A machine learning model that predicts the actual number of students expected to attend an exam based on survey/enrollment data.

## Project Setup

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/exam-room-manager.git
cd exam-room-manager
```

**2. Create the database**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE exam_room_manager;
```

**3. Configure `application.properties`**
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/exam_room_manager
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=your_password

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
spring.flyway.enabled=true
spring.flyway.locations=classpath:db/migration
spring.flyway.validate-on-migrate=false
spring.thymeleaf.cache=false
```

**4. Run the application**
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**5. Open in browser**
```
http://localhost:8080/login
```

---

## Prediction Model Setup

**1. Navigate to the ml/ folder**
```bash
cd ml/
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn pandas joblib jupyter
```

**3. Train the model (run all cells in the notebook)**
```bash
jupyter notebook attendance_prediction.ipynb
```

**4. Start the FastAPI server**
```bash
python main.py
```

**5. The ML service runs on:**
```
http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage
On the exam options page, enter the number of students and click **Predict Attendance** to get a prediction of how many students will actually show up.

**The FastAPI server must be running alongside the Spring Boot application for the prediction feature to work.**
